		After graduating from Northeastern University with a BA in Communication Studies and a minor in Business, I started working in Marketing for an energy efficiency company in downtown Boston. After my team became responsible for launching the next iteration of our corporate website, I took an interest in HTML. It has evolved from an interest into a passion and I am excited for the opportunity to grow my skills in HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript. I look forward to learning with you all in the coming months and seeing where this program takes me next.
